CDN Mirror
==========

This is a collection of popular JavaScript and CSS libraries, intended to be used with the [local_cdn Ruby gem](http://github.com/alexreisner/local_cdn) for Rails applications. The gem allows these libraries to be served from localhost when accessing the site locally in the development environment, so you don't lose look/functionality when you're working without an Internet connection. In order for this to work you need to emulate a CDN locally, and that's what CDN Mirror is for.

Please contribute and help keep these libraries up to date!
